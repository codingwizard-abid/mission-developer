               </h2>
               <p>Becoming a web developer is not hard but it requires a lot of hard-work, passion, determination and curiosity. I do a lot of research on google youtube while learning cause I know that only the given content is not enough for deep learning. Doing research, get stuck somewhere find bugs fix them is the real lerning attitude. Thats why I work 8-10 dadicated hours to fulfil my dream.
